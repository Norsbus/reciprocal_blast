will produce csv files in presence_absence/{genome}.csv with structure:

gene,present,changed to present although not primary reverse hit because its still very significant and the difference to the primary reverse hit is not too large as defined in "levels" and applied in "evaluate.py"

python3 prep.py
python3 main1.py
python3 main2.py
python3 main3.py

optional to get the presence absence per gene in pa_per_gene/{gene}.csv (after running the above)
./get_pa_per_gene.py
